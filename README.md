# DiceRoller
This is a basic dice (or die) roller I created using Python. It saved me time and money from buying actual dice when I'm playing a game or something. <br><br>
It uses elements of ASCII art to display a dice interface for the user to see what was rolled, as well at the total of what they rolled (the sum of the numbers).
